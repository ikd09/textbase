# textbase
a simple text base with information about random topics.

This is a storage base for text that will be insterted progressively. It is currently for the badBowl project. The code for badBowl will be released on March 10th, 2023. At that point, it will be a single-player quizbowl with adjustable questions:

Here's what it currently does:

-Displays text on the screen at an adjustable rate and can be disrupted at the user's command.
-Chooses at random a paragraph from the textbase.txt file in this repository.

What is to be added:

-Neural Network generated questions and answers.
-Different categories.
-A multiplayer option.
-Proper CSS

More things may be added to the "What is to be added" checklist, but as of February 16th, 2023, this is currently what is coming.

This README will hopefully be updated weekly. If not, then this project is likely under light development or discontinued altogether.
